During G2 and early mitosis, CDC25A/B/C-mediated dephosphorylation activates CDK1/cyclin complexes which phosphorylate several substrates that trigger at least centrosome separation, Golgi dynamics, nuclear envelope breakdown and chromosome condensation. Once chromosomes are condensed and aligned at the metaphase plate, CDK1 activity is switched off by WEE1- and PKMYT1-mediated phosphorylation to allow sister chromatid separation, chromosome decondensation, reformation of the nuclear envelope and cytokinesis.

Reactivated after successful DNA repair through WIP1-dependent signaling leading to CDC25A/B/C-mediated dephosphorylation and restoring cell cycle progression. In proliferating cells, CDK1-mediated FOXO1 phosphorylation at the G2-M phase represses FOXO1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and thereby promotes FOXO1 nuclear accumulation and transcription factor activity, leading to cell death of postmitotic neurons.

MAPK3;P27361;5595;" Serine/threonine kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade plays also a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors.

MAP2K4 shows preference for phosphorylation of the Tyr residue and MAP2K7/MKK7 for the Thr residue. The phosphorylation of the Thr residue by MAP2K7/MKK7 seems to be the prerequisite for JNK activation at least in response to proinflammatory cytokines, while other stimuli activate both MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 which synergistically phosphorylate JNKs. MAP2K4 is required for maintaining peripheral lymphoid homeostasis. The MKK/JNK signaling pathway is also involved in mitochondrial death signaling pathway, including the release cytochrome c, leading to apoptosis.

May be involved in cell differentiation, apoptosis, immune response and regulation of K channels. Involved in endosome organization by retaining vesicles in the perinuclear cloud: following ubiquitination by RNF26, attracts specific vesicle-associated adapters, forming a molecular bridge that restrains cognate vesicles in the perinuclear region and organizes the endosomal pathway for efficient cargo transport . .;Sequestosome-1 
STAT1;P42224;6772; Signal transducer and transcription activator that mediates cellular responses to interferons , cytokine KITLG/SCF and other cytokines and other growth factors. Following type I IFN  binding to cell surface receptors, signaling via protein kinases leads to activation of Jak kinases  and to tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. The phosphorylated STATs dimerize and associate with ISGF3G/IRF-9 to form a complex termed ISGF3 transcription factor, that enters the nucleus . ISGF3 binds to the IFN stimulated response element  to activate the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes , which drive the cell in an antiviral state. In response to type II IFN , STAT1 is tyrosine- and serine-phosphorylated . It then forms a homodimer termed IFN-gamma-activated factor , migrates into the nucleus and binds to the IFN gamma activated sequence  to drive the expression of the target genes, inducing a cellular antiviral state. Becomes activated in response to KITLG/SCF and KIT signaling. May mediate cellular responses to activated FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4. .;Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-alpha/beta

Once activated, recruits coactivators, such as NCOA1 or MED1, to the promoter region of the target gene . May mediate cellular responses to activated FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4 . Binds to the interleukin-6 -responsive elements identified in the promoters of various acute-phase protein genes . Activated by IL31 through IL31RA . Acts as a regulator of inflammatory response by regulating differentiation of naive CD4 T-cells into T-helper Th17 or regulatory T-cells : deacetylation and oxidation of lysine residues by LOXL3, leads to disrupt STAT3 dimerization and inhibit its transcription activity . Involved in cell cycle regulation by inducing the expression of key genes for the progression from G1 to S phase, such as CCND1 . Mediates the effects of LEP on melanocortin production, body energy homeostasis and lactation . May play an apoptotic role by transctivating BIRC5 expression under LEP activation . Cytoplasmic STAT3 represses macroautophagy by inhibiting EIF2AK2/PKR activity . Plays a crucial role in basal beta cell functions, such as regulation of insulin secretion . .;Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3

UBE2L3;P68036;7332; Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 that specifically acts with HECT-type and RBR family E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases. Does not function with most RING-containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases because it lacks intrinsic E3-independent reactivity with lysine: in contrast, it has activity with the RBR family E3 enzymes, such as PRKN and ARIH1, that function like function like RING-HECT hybrids. Accepts ubiquitin from the E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins. In vitro catalyzes Lys-11-linked polyubiquitination.
